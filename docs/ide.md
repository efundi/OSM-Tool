### TSLint
TSlint provides feedback on coding stardards configured by various tslint.json files. The project makes use of the default configuration provided by Angular.

Initially it can be quite daunting to fix all the suggestions, but once done it is easy to keep it up to date

To enable IDE feedback for TSLint, a TSlint compatible IDE is required. Here weâ€™ll show how to configure with IntelliJ

1. Firstly make sure NodeJS and NPM is properly configured for your project
2. Open project settings screen, and navigate to Languages & Frameworks > TSLint
3. Select Automatic TSLint configuration
4. Your IDE will now validate javascript and typescript files and provide feedback and recommendations
